  What we didn't expect was the test on recalling the start and end dates of every job we've had since high school.  We didn't expect to be quizzed on our childhood history, or to have our children brought into the great inquisition too.

Lindsay and I spent the last week in full-on home-study mode.  We knew the basic parts of a home study, and what that would include.  We assumed our case worker would make sure there was a safe home, and that our parenting style was one that would align with having another child in the home.  

What we did not expect was the test on recalling the start and end dates of every job we have had since high school.  We did not expect to be quizzed on our childhood history, or to have our children brought into the "great inquisition" too.  

It has been a crazy week for us, and we have had to keep our house uber-clean, much akin to when we sold our previous house and had visitors looking at it every day.  I am sooo very thankful for the fact that these home study interviews are now behind us!  We are anxiously awaiting the home study recommendations to be written up and delivered to us.  We know, at this point, that nothing stands in our way with respect to the homestudy and we are excited to start the next step.

What is on the horizon for us?  Once we are "officially" qualified to be adoptive parents, We will be applying directly to our adoption agency and asking for our profile to be shown to expectant mothers wishing for their child to be adopted. We respect and pray for those mothers as this choice is not made easily. 

Thank ALL of you for your support in our journey.  When our home study report is finalized, we are excited to offer each of you a tax-deductible means to donate to our cause! The IRS, sadly, does not allow for deductions to be made until the adoptive parents are vetted by a home study. This process has been tedious, and we could not have made it without the support of our friends and family.
