For instance, my youngest son would rather play Mario on the Wii (with a remote that doesn\'t actually work) than use the bathroom, so he will happily stand with stained britches in the living room. My oldest son has such great confidence that he sometimes believes he doesn’t have to pay attention to directions, or to anything, because he frankly already knows what you’re about to say.  And of course, there have been sleepless nights, never ending days, mountains of laundry, and plenty of tears.  The need for coffee increased immensely as they entered my life. 
 
The other side of it though, is that before I can muster the energy to get out of bed to use the bathroom in the morning, my boys have run down the stairs, past the living room, and taken a flying leap into my bed to start their day with snuggles. They work together to achieve noteworthy tasks (like pegging me in the head with pillow when I walk through the living room…. Or feeding the dogs, or clearing the table… ).  They sing songs, and learn about the world.  They try to make it better.  They always forgive.  They don’t see anyone as inferior, or have any preconceived notions about people.  They don’t know stereotypes.  They just love.  They make me a better person. 
 
And they are funny.  When we went to the ultra sound for our second viable pregnancy, we had a fancy ultrasound as we were “high risk”.  We brought Elijah with us so he could see his baby sibling.  I remember crying when they showed me the four chambers of the heart, and functioning kidneys, and a liver, that all worked! I remember five fingers and toes on each hand or foot and being so relieved that our baby would make it.  Then I composed myself and got myself back together as the gender was revealed to us.  “It’s a boy” the nurse said.  Elijah lost it.  I mean, full on, crying kicking and screaming on the floor, hysteria.  “I WANTED A SISTER!!”  Luckily, his brother is not as much of a disappointment as anticipated. They quite like each other. 
 
We are going to bring home a sister. If living with two boys is this amazing, and we still have so much love to offer, we all will certainly have room for more morning snuggles, and potty training debacles, and pillow warfare.
