Our adoption journey began on Saturday when we announced to close family and friends that the unquenchable
desire in our hearts to adopt a baby girl was one that we are choosing to honor.

First to hear the news was Elijah. At first he sat there laughing and smiling in disbelief.  Then he said,
"Really?!?!" and we said "Yes!" and this was the face we got:

We had a few conversations with close family members, and we have received an overwelming amount of support from everybody.  The support we received from our friends on Facebook was also incredible and 
encouraging.  We are thankful for you. We will keep you up to date as we progress toward making our dream a reality.
