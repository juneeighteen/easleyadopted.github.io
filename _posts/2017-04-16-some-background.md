When we considered having more children, as our last pregnancy 
was successful and gave us Grant, we were burdened with fear about what might come.  When we began to 
consider adoption we were both struck by the awe of it all; the sacrificial nature of a woman knowing 
she would not be able to care for her child when it is born, but still carrying it for nine months; and families bringing children home who may not look like them, talk like them, have the same interests as them, and unconditionally loving every bit of their differences.  
  
... And so we decided. Now we are on a journey.  We hope you will help us as we metaphorically travel through this.  You can help by sharing in our excitement and telling us that it excites you.  You can help by praying for us.  You can even help by telling us how extraodinarily adventurous our journey is, because every iota of validation is helpful, and of course... you can donate.
